<h2 class="uk-h2">
  Remove Old Files
</h2>
<p>
glFusion v1.6.0 has re-organized many files. Please remove the following files / directories:
</p>
<ul class="uk-list">
  <li>public_html/ckeditor/plugins/filemanager/* - We have replaced the <b>CKEditor FileManager Plugin</b> with a new file manager called <b>FileMan</b>.  Please completely remove the <b>filemanager</b> directory.</li>
  <li>public_html/layout/cms/plugins/ - glFusion v1.6.0 has moved all the custom plugin template files to the plugin's template directory - the old template files need to be deleted. Please delete all files and directories under the <b>public_html/layout/cms/plugins/</b> directory (keep the plugins directory for future use).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Will put a link to the glFusion Documentation Wiki for more detailed instructions...</p>
