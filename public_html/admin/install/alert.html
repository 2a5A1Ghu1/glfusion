<h1>Remove Old Files</h1>
<p>With glFusion v1.6.0, there has been a significant restructuring of files in the CKEditor plugin and in the CMS theme. Please read the information below and ensure you remove the files that are no longer needed.</p>
<h2>CKEditor FileManager</h2>
<p>We have replaced the image browser, FileManager, in CKEditor with FileMan. As a result, you no longer need the FileManager files.  Please remove the following directory (and all files included in this directory):</p>
<pre>
public_html/ckeditor/plugins/filemanager/
</pre>
<p>It is important to remove these as they will no longer be updated.</p>
<h2>CMS Theme File Structure</h2>
<p>
	With glFusion v1.6.0, we have moved all the plugin templates files from the CMS theme directory,
	back to the plugin&#39;s theme directory in the private/plugins/ space.
	It is important that you remove the old <em>custom</em> plugins files in the CMS theme directory.
</p>
<div class="uk-alert uk-alert-warning">
	<strong>CAUTION: </strong>If you have updated or customized any of these templates,
	<strong>do not</strong> delete your customized files.
</div>
<p>
	The files to delete are located in the following directory:
</p>
<pre>public_html/layout/cms/plugins/</pre>
<p>
It is safe to delete all files in this directory, but please leave the <strong>plugins/</strong> directory - it should be empty (unless you leave any of your customized templates). Going forward, if you wish to customize a plugin&#39;s templates, you can store them in&nbsp;<strong>public_html/layout/cms/plugins/PLUGINNAME/templatefile.thtml</strong>&nbsp;- in the future, this directory will never be overwritten by glFusion, allowing your customizations to remain after upgrades.</p>
</p>

<p>
	For more detailed information on what files to remove, please see the glFusion Documentation Wiki - Upgrading to glFusion v1.6.x
