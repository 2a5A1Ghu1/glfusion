<p>To successfully install and use glFusion you must have a fully
operational web server, a database, and the server side scripting
language <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>.
glFusion is developed and tested primarily on the Apache web server
version 2.x, but it should run on any modern web server. glFusion has
been successfully installed and is running on other web servers such as
Zeus, Lighttpd, and Microsoft <acronym title="Internet Information Services">IIS</acronym>.

</p>


<p>
glFusion still supports <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> v4.x, but the <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> Foundation has already announced the end of life of the v4.x branch.  Using <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> v5.x series is a better long term choice.  Currently, the Web Services feature of glFusion requires <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> 5.  If you are running <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> v4.x, Web Services will be automatically disabled.

</p>


<p>
glFusion supports MySQL database.

<p>glFusion is designed where some of the files should reside outside
of the web root, meaning they should not be directly accessible from
the Internet. For most users this does not pose a problem, but some
hosting services do not allow users to store files outside of the main
web accessible directory. For these users, you can still install
glFusion, but you will want to follow the directions in the installing
glFusion in the web root section.
</p>


<p>
Make sure you know where your web root is on your server.  This is different than your website's <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>

It is important that you know this information prior to performing the
installation.

<div class="level2">

<p>glFusion requires a MySQL database. Depending on your hosting
solution, you may need to create a new database for glFusion and also a
database user account. Some hosting providers setup a single database
for your account that should be used. If you already have a database
created that you wish to use, you can skip this section.

<p>To install glFusion you will need to un-archive the distribution on
your local computer. The glFusion distribution archive will
automatically create all the proper directories when it is un-archived.
</p>


<p>
To un-archive a .gz file, you can use recent versions of <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.rarlab.com/" rel="nofollow">WinRAR</a> or <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.7-zip.org/" rel="nofollow">7-Zip</a>.  If you are running <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.apple.com/macosx/" rel="nofollow">Mac OSX</a>, please ensure you have the latest version of <a href="http://my.smithmicro.com/mac/stuffitdeluxe/index.html" class="urlextern" title="http://my.smithmicro.com/mac/stuffitdeluxe/index.html" rel="nofollow">StuffIt</a> installed as previous versions have had difficulty properly un-archiving .gz files.  For Linux/Unix users, use the standard <code>tar</code> command to extract the distribution.

<p>Setting the permissions will vary from server to server, and depend

<p>

If you use <acronym title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</acronym> to upload files to your server, you can use your <acronym title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</acronym> program to change the permissions. Below is an example of using FileZilla as the <acronym title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</acronym> program to set permissions:

<div class="level1">

<p>Before you begin the upgrade process, make a good backup of your
source files and your database. The upgrade process is generally very
safe, however, there is always the possibility that something could go
wrong and part of any good upgrade plan is a good back out plan.
</p>


<div class="notewarning">
If you have made any customizations to glFusion's core files or the theme files, ensure you save a copy of your modifications.

</div>


<p>glFusion brings some major architectural changes that break away
from how upgrades were handled in previous versions of Geeklog. The
main change is that the config.php file is no longer used by glFusion.
Instead, most of the configuration options are now maintained with an
online configuration editor and the configuration files are
automatically updated during the upgrade process. There are a few
configuration options that are still maintained in the db-config.php
(database settings) and siteconfig.php (site specific options such as
Character Set), but you should not have to edit these files directly.
Also, you no longer need to edit lib-common.php to specify the path to
config.php as you did with previous versions of Geeklog.
</p>


<p>The upgrade process does not migrate your existing configuration
options from the old config.php file. You will need to enter the Online
Configuration section after the upgrade and set the options to meet
your specific needs.
</p>


<div class="noteimportant">
Be sure to check the Requirements list below to validate your site can be upgraded successfully.

<div class="level2">

<p>glFusion v1.1.8 supports migrating your existing Geeklog 1.4.1+ site by performing the Migration process.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You must be running Geeklog v1.5.0 or higher to migrate. If you have an
older Geeklog site, please upgrade it to at least Geeklog v1.4.1 before
migrating.</span>
</p>glFusion v1.1.x has some major changes in the theme engine. glFusion uses a <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>, non-table based theme engine which is very different than Geeklog's implementation.  glFusion v1.1.x does offer <em>legacy theme</em> support, which means any Geeklog theme that is based off their standard <em>Professional</em>
theme should work, but you will not get all the new features and
benefits available in glFusion. For full details, please see the <a href="http://www.glfusion.org/wiki/doku.php/glfusion:theme#legacy_theme_support" class="wikilink1" title="glfusion:theme">Legacy Theme</a> section in the glFusion wiki.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">The glFusion team recommends that you use the standard Nouveau theme
included in glFusion. If you have a heavily customized legacy theme,
you may want to stick with Geeklog or at least try the migration on a
test system before migrating a production system.
</span><p>
Copy all the glFusion source files to your server. Once you have
uploaded all the files, open your browser and navigate to the glFusion
installation wizard. The path to this file will depend on where you
chose to put the glFusion files on your web server. The default
location is: </p>

<p>
<code><span class="urlextern">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;http://Your_glFusion_Site/admin/install/index.php</span></code>
</p>

<p>
Choose the <strong>Migrate</strong> button.  The migration wizard is designed to automate the upgrade process. Simply follow the migration steps.
</p>

<p>
Once you have completed the upgrade be sure to delete the admin/install directory.
</p>

<p>
Congratulations! You now have glFusion successfully installed. Please
take a moment to review the rest of this manual to better understand
how to administer the features and functions of this software.
