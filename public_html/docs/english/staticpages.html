<p>The Static Pages plugin was originally aimed at creating pages
with static content (as opposed to the dynamic pages created by
glFusion) - hence the name. Pages like an &ldquo;about
us&rdquo; page, a mission statement, etc. would come to mind. </p>


<p>Since then, people have used the static pages for all kinds of
things and with the inclusion of <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> into
static pages, even the original name isn't quite right any more

of PHP</a></h1>


<div class="level1">PHP &nbsp;in Staticpages is enabled by default on
new install of glFusion. &nbsp;It is important to understand if you
allow other users (members of the Static Page Admin group) to create
staticpages, you may elect to disable the use of PHP in static pages.
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<h2><a id="activating_php" name="activating_php">De-Activating
PHP</a></h2>
To disaable <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>
use, you will have to remove the 'staticpages.<acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>'
permission from the &ldquo;Static Page Admin&rdquo; group. To do
this, log in as the Admin and from the Admin's Only block, select
&ldquo;Groups&rdquo;. Find the &ldquo;Static Page
Admin&rdquo; group and edit it by clicking on the name of the
group. At the bottom of the page, you will find a list of
&ldquo;Rights&rdquo; (permissions) that can be granted to all
members of this group. Note that 'staticpages.delete' and
'staticpages.edit' are also checked. To remove the ability for&nbsp; members of the Static Page Admin group to use <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> in static
pages, you will have to un-check the 'staticpages.<acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>' checkbox
and save your changes.<br />
<br />
<p>In addition to the 'staticpages.<acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>'
permission discussed above, there is also a global option to disable
the use of <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>
in static pages entirely. That option &ldquo;Allow <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>?&rdquo;
can be found in the Configuration admin panel for the static pages
plugin. When set to &ldquo;False&rdquo;, that option will
override the 'staticpages.<acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>
' permission and disable all use of <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> in static
pages.</p>

<div class="noteclassic">The use of <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> in static
pages may result in security issues if not used properly. Use this
feature with care! </div>


<p>The use of <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>
has to be enabled for each individual static page. Below the content
edit field, you will find a drop-down menu with the following options: </p>


<table class="inline">


  <tbody>


    <tr class="row0">


      <td class="col0 leftalign">do not execute <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> </td>

      <td class="col1 leftalign">If you select this

code in static pages will be executed. The 'return' indicates that the
code should return any output it generates, using a <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> return
statement, instead of printing it out directly. </td>


    </tr>


    <tr class="row2">


      <td class="col0 leftalign">execute <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> </td>

    </tr>



  </tbody>
</table>


<p>Please note that when embedding <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> code in a
static page, your code should not be enclosed in the <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>
&lt;?php and ?&gt; tags. Instead, it is assumed that the static
page contains the <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>
code that would normally go between those two tags. </p>


<p>When selecting the third of the above <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> execution
options (&ldquo;execute <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>&rdquo;)
you can switch back and forth between <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> and plain
<acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym>
like this: </p>


<pre class="code">echo "Hello"; ?&gt;, &lt;b&gt;world&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;?php echo "how are you?";</pre>


<p>The above example would print out &ldquo;Hello, <b>world</b>, how
are you?&rdquo;. </p>


</div>


<h1><a id="page_id" name="page_id">Page ID</a></h1>


<div class="level1">
<p>When creating a new static page, it will be assigned a page ID
automatically. This ID consists of the date and time and up to three
random digits. When you anticipate that the <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym> of this
page may be used a lot, e.g. quoted in emails, it may make sense to use
a more readable ID for the page. </p>


<p>The static pages editor will let you change the page ID. For
example, you may want to rename the ID for your
&ldquo;about&rdquo; page from
&ldquo;20030313100131123&rdquo; to &ldquo;about&rdquo;,
thus creating a <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>
like </p>


<pre class="code">http://yoursite/staticpages/index.php?page=about</pre>


<p>which looks much nicer when quoted (and is easier to
remember). You could further improve this by making use of glFusion's <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym> rewrite
feature. </p>


<p>Please note that you should only use letters and digits for
the page ID. Avoid national special characters, most punctuation
characters ('-' and '.' should be okay, though) and spaces. The static
page editor will catch some illegal characters but not all of them
&hellip; Using Static Pages on the index page </p>


<p>glFusion's Center Blocks concept allows plugins to place
blocks in the center area of a glFusion site, i.e. among the stories. </p>


<p>When you check the &ldquo;Centerblock&rdquo; option
for a static page, you can use the &ldquo;Position&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Topic&rdquo; drop-downs to chose where this static page
will be displayed. For &ldquo;Position&rdquo;, the options are
&ldquo;Top Of Page&rdquo;, &ldquo;After Featured
Story&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bottom Of Page&rdquo; (which should be
self-explanatory) and &ldquo;Entire Page&rdquo;. That last
option, &ldquo;Entire Page&rdquo;, will tell glFusion that this
static page will replace the entire index page - it will not display
any stories, but only the contents of this static page. This is useful
e.g. for &ldquo;splash&rdquo; screens or Welcome pages. </p>


<div class="notetip">When using a static page as a
&ldquo;splash&rdquo; screen, you may need a link that takes
your visitors to the normal index page, i.e. the list of current
stories. To do this, create a link to index.php?display=all </div>


<p>The second drop-down, &ldquo;Topic&rdquo;, lets you
restrict the display of a static page to only a certain topic, the
homepage only, or all pages (i.e. all topic pages and the homepage).
This is the same as the options you have for blocks. </p>


<div class="notetip">You can combine these options with
the permission settings. This will let you, for example, create a
&ldquo;welcome&rdquo; page that is only displayed to anonymous
users. </div>


</div>


<h1><a id="sorting" name="sorting">Sorting</a></h1>


<div class="level1">
<p>Centerblocks: When you have more than one static page that
would appear in the same section of the center area (e.g. two static
pages that would be displayed at the top of the index page), you can
choose the order in which they appear from the Configuration admin
panel for the static pages plugin. Your options are: </p>


<ul>


  <li class="level1">

    <div class="li">Date (sort by last changed date)</div>


  </li>


  <li class="level1">

    <div class="li">Page ID (sort by the page id; default)</div>


  </li>


  <li class="level1">

    <div class="li">Page Title (sort by the page title)</div>


  </li>


</ul>


<p>Please note that this order will only apply to centerblocks
from static pages. All other plugins creating centerblocks will not be
in that order. Also note that the centerblock is not necessarily
looking like a standard glFusion block. To achieve that, please check
the field &ldquo;Wrapping Static Pages in a block&rdquo; below.
</p>


<p>Menu entries: It's also possible to sort the static pages that
are displayed in the site's menu (if you're using a theme that uses the
{plg_menu_elements} variables in its header.thtml). This sort order can
also be changed in the Configuration admin panel for the static pages
plugin: </p>


<ul>


  <li class="level1">

    <div class="li">Date (sort by last changed date)</div>


  </li>


  <li class="level1">

    <div class="li">Label (sort by the menu label text;
default)</div>


  </li>


  <li class="level1">

    <div class="li">Page ID (sort by the page id)</div>


  </li>


  <li class="level1">

    <div class="li">Page Title (sort by the page title)</div>


  </li>


</ul>


</div>


<h1><a id="wrapping_static_pages_in_a_block" name="wrapping_static_pages_in_a_block">Wrapping Static
Pages in a block</a></h1>


<div class="level1">
<p>You can chose to have a static page wrapped in a glFusion
block-layout by checking the &ldquo;wrap static page in a
block&rdquo; option in the static pages editor. If selected, the
page's title will be used as the block title. Further, you can, as with
normal blocks, enter a help <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>. If
this <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>
is entered, the block will display a help icon linking to that <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>. </p>


<p>The default for this option can be set in the Configuration
admin panel for the static pages plugin. Cloning Static Pages </p>


<p>When you have a lot of similar static pages you may want to
make a copy of an existing page and then edit that copy. This can
easily be done by clicking on the [C] from the list of static pages.
Doing so will create a copy of that page with a new page ID. </p>


</div>


<h1><a id="url_rewriting" name="url_rewriting">URL
rewriting</a></h1>


<div class="level1">
<p>Please note that this feature is considered experimental and
is known not to work with <acronym title="Internet Information Services">IIS</acronym>. </p>


<p>glFusion supports a form of <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>
rewriting, i.e. change the look of URLs such that they are more search
engine friendly. For example, instead of </p>


<pre class="code"> http://yoursite/staticpages/index.php?page=20030313100131123</pre>


<p>the <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>
could look like this </p>


<pre class="code"> http://yoursite/staticpages/index.php/20030313100131123</pre>


<p>Some search engines are known not to index pages when the <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>
includes characters like '?' and '='. You could further improve the
chances of this page being indexed by replacing the numeric page ID
with a word or expression (preferrably something that corresponds to
the page's content), e.g. </p>


<pre class="code"> http://yoursite/staticpages/index.php/about</pre>


<p>To make use of <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>
rewriting, you will need to set the option &ldquo;Enable <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>
Rewriting&rdquo; to True in glFusion's Configuration admin panel. </p>


</div>


<h1><a id="deleting_pages_with_their_owner" name="deleting_pages_with_their_owner">Deleting pages with
their owner</a></h1>


<div class="level1">
<p>As all objects in glFusion, static pages have an owner (the
user that created the static page). When that user's account is deleted
for some reason, any static pages owned by that user can either be
deleted as well or they can be assigned to another user in glFusion's
Root group. </p>


<p>In the Configuration admin panel for the static pages plugin,
you can set the &ldquo;Delete Pages with Owner?&rdquo; option
to either &ldquo;False&rdquo; (which is also the default),
meaning that static pages will not be deleted withtheir owner, but
assigned to a member of the Root group instead (the user withthe lowest
user ID, most likely the Admin). Setting the option to
&ldquo;True&rdquo; means that static pages will be deleted when
their owner's account is deleted.</p>
