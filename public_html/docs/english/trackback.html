<h1><a name="trackback_pingback_ping" id="trackback_pingback_ping">Trackback, Pingback, Ping</a></h1>

<div class="level1">
<p>Trackbacks, Pingbacks, and Pings are mostly used in blog
communities to
inform other sites / blogs about updated blogs and comments made to
blog posts. These methods are supported by many blog / <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym>
packages, so you can also send Trackbacks and Pingbacks to sites
running on software other than glFusion.
</p>

<ul>

  <li class="level1">
    <div class="li"> Trackbacks are a means to connect a
post you made on your blog to a post on another blog. <br />

E.g. Mary posts something on her blog. Peter reads that, makes a post
about Mary's post on his own site and then sends a trackback to Mary's
site, so that Mary and visitors of Mary's site will know about Peter's
post.</div>

  </li>

  <li class="level1">
    <div class="li"> Pingbacks are pretty much the same as
Trackbacks, they only use a different protocol.</div>

  </li>

  <li class="level1">
    <div class="li"> Sending a Ping is meant to inform
sites that keep track of updated blogs that you've made a new post.
These weblog directories or aggregators usually offer a way to
subscribe to this update information, so that you don't have to visit
several sites to find the new posts.</div>

  </li>

</ul>

<p>
For more information, please consult Wikipedia on TrackBack and
Pingback. You can also spend some time reading up on Weblogs in general
there &hellip;
</p>

</div>

<h2><a name="usage" id="usage">Usage</a></h2>

<div class="level2">
<p>To pick up the above example, here's how trackback, etc. work:
Assume you're Peter and just read a post on Mary's blog about her
little lamb. Say that post has the <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym> <a href="http://www.example.com/article.php/little-lamb" class="urlextern" title="http://www.example.com/article.php/little-lamb" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.com/article.php/little-lamb</a>.
</p>

<p>
Peter now goes and writes a new story, linking to Mary's post.
Something like:
</p>

<p>
I just read that Mary &lt;a href=&ldquo;<a href="http://www.example.com/article.php/little-lamb" class="urlextern" title="http://www.example.com/article.php/little-lamb" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.com/article.php/little-lamb</a>&rdquo;&gt;has
a little lamb&lt;/a&gt;. Hope she posts some pictures soon!
</p>

<p>
After saving that story, there is an option &ldquo;send
ping&rdquo; in the Admin's
list of stories (last column). Clicking on the link presents you with a
list of options: Send Pingback, Send Ping, Send Trackback (some of
those may have been disabled and not show up - see below).
</p>

</div>

<h2><a name="pingback" id="pingback">Pingback</a></h2>

<div class="level2">
<p>Sending a Pingback is an automated process: After clicking on
that
link, glFusion scans your story for links to other sites and tries to
send a Pingback to all those sites that accept Pingbacks. The Pingback
will automatically include a link back to your story.
</p>

</div>

<h2><a name="trackback" id="trackback">Trackback</a></h2>

<div class="level2">
<p>(We're skipping sending Pings for the moment - see below)
</p>

<p>A Trackback can only be sent to one site, so you are now
presented
with a list of all the links in your story and have to choose which
site should receive the trackback. glFusion will then check if the site
accepts trackbacks and try to determine the actual trackback <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym> to send
the Trackback to.
</p>

<p>
You will now get a form that includes information about your post
(title, <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>,
<acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>
of your site and the text of your post). If glFusion could determine
the Trackback <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>,
that field will also be filled in. If the Trackback <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym> is
missing, then either glFusion could not find the Trackback <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym> by
itself (in which case you can add it manually) or the target site
(Mary's, in the above example) does not accept Trackbacks.
</p>

<p>
You can - and should - now edit the excerpt from your post. Please note
that many sites will shorten the excerpt, typically to something like
255 characters. Also keep in mind that the excerpt will be displayed on
Mary's site, so it should contain a portion of your post that will make
it clear to a visitor of Mary's site why that post shows up there (i.e.
it should somehow refer to Mary's post).
</p>

<p>You can then choose to see a preview of your post (but keep in
mind
that it may not be displayed in the exact same way on Mary's site) and
/ or send the Trackback.
</p>

</div>

<h1><a name="trackback_vs._pingback" id="trackback_vs._pingback">Trackback vs. Pingback</a></h1>

<div class="level1">
<p>Since, as mentioned above, Trackback and Pingback offer pretty
much
the same functionality, you should really only send one of the two. So
if Mary's site offers both options, you should think about which of the
two makes more sense to you for that particular post.
</p>

<p>Pingbacks provide less information (typically only a link back
to
your site) but they are automated and therefore easier and faster to
send. Trackbacks allow you to send more information (e.g. an excerpt
from your post) but preparing that information takes more time.
</p>

</div>

<h1><a name="receiving_trackbacks_and_pingbacks" id="receiving_trackbacks_and_pingbacks">Receiving Trackbacks
and Pingbacks</a></h1>

<div class="level1">
<p>Your glFusion site will, of course, be able to receive
Trackbacks
and Pingbacks to your stories. They will show up in a dedicated section
below the story, similar to the section for comments. Once received,
glFusion will treat Trackbacks and Pingbacks the same, so you won't be
able to tell the difference.
</p>

<p>
When you disable Trackbacks and / or Pingbacks in the configuration,
you will also disable receiving them.
</p>

</div>

<h1><a name="ping" id="ping">Ping</a></h1>

<div class="level1">
<p>Pings are meant to be sent to certain websites that keep track
of
blog posts. glFusion comes pre-configured for pinging Ping-o-Matic, a
service that in turn will ping other services (see their site for
details). You can easily add others or delete / disable the existing
entry (from the Admin's &ldquo;Trackback&rdquo; entry).
</p>

<p>Weblog directory services will usually accept either a
standard or
an extended ping. The difference is that the
&ldquo;extended&rdquo; Ping will also
include a link to your site's feed (<acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym>, Atom, or
whatever you chose).
</p>

<p>
When you click on the &ldquo;Send Ping&rdquo; button for a
story, all currently enabled weblog directories will be notified
automatically.
</p>

<p>
Pinging a weblog directory service will also ensure that your site is
included in Google's blog search.
</p>

</div>

<h1><a name="disabling_trackbacks" id="disabling_trackbacks">Disabling Trackbacks</a></h1>

<div class="level1">
<p>Since these functions may not be needed on certain sites (e.g.
corporate sites), they can be switched off individually in the
configuration.
</p>

<p>Note that &ldquo;Trackback&rdquo; is sometimes used as
a generic term for both
trackbacks and pingbacks. So when you disable trackbacks but leave
pingbacks enabled, you will still see references to
&ldquo;Trackback&rdquo; in a
few places.
</p>

<p>Only when all three, i.e. trackbacks, pingbacks, and pings are
disabled will the &ldquo;Trackback&rdquo; entry vanish from the
Admins Only block.
At that point, the only reference to trackbacks that you'll still see
is the drop-down menu entry in the Admin's story editor (to
enable/disable trackbacks on a per-story basis). But its setting is
overridden by the configuration settings, so it can be ignored.
