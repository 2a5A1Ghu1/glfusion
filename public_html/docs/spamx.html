<div class="level1">
<p>The glFusion Spam-X plugin was created to fight the problem of
comment
spam for glFusion systems. If you are unfamiliar with comment spam you
might see the Comment Spam Manifesto.
</p>


<p>Spam protection in glFusion is mostly based on the Spam-X
plugin,
originally developed by Tom Willet. It has a modular architecture that
allows it to be extended with new modules to fight the spammer's latest
tricks, should the need arise.
What is being checked for spam?
</p>


<p>
glFusion and the Spam-X plugin will check the following for spam:
</p>


<ul>


  <li class="level1">
    
    <div class="li"> Story submissions</div>


  </li>


  <li class="level1">
    
    <div class="li"> Comments</div>


  </li>


  <li class="level1">
    
    <div class="li"> Trackbacks and Pingbacks</div>


  </li>


  <li class="level1">

<h1><a name="module_types" id="module_types">Module
Types</a></h1>


<div class="level1">
<p>The Spam-X plugin was built to be expandable to easily adapt
to
changes the comment spammers might make. There are three types of
modules: Examine, Action, and Admin. A new module is contained in a
file and can simply be dropped in and it will be added to the plugin.
Examine Modules
</p>


<p>
glFusion ships with the following examine modules:
</p>


<ul>


  <li class="level1">
    
    <div class="li"> Spam Link Verification (SLV)</div>


  </li>


  <li class="level1">
    
    <div class="li"> Personal Blacklist</div>


  </li>


  <li class="level1">
    
    <div class="li"> IP Filter</div>


  </li>


  <li class="level1">
    
    <div class="li"> IP of <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym> Filter</div>


  </li>


  <li class="level1">
    
    <div class="li"> <acronym title="Hyper Text Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym>
Header Filter</div>


  </li>


</ul>


</div>


<h2><a name="spam_link_verification_slv" id="spam_link_verification_slv">Spam Link Verification (SLV)</a></h2>


<div class="level2">
<p>SLV is a centralized, server-based service that examines posts
made
on websites and detects when certain links show up in unusually high
numbers. In other words, when a spammer starts spamming a lot of sites
with the same URLs and those sites all report to SLV, the system will
recognize this as a spam wave and will flag posts containing these URLs
as spam.
</p>


<p>In other words still, it's a dynamic blacklist that
automatically
updates itself when a spammer starts spamming for their site. And it
can only get better (in terms of accuracy and reaction speed) the more
sites use it.
</p>


<p>
SLV is a free service run by Russ Jones at <a href="http://www.linksleeve.org" class="urlextern" title="http://www.linksleeve.org" rel="nofollow">www.linksleeve.org</a>.
</p>


<p>Privacy Notice: It should be stressed that using SLV means
that
information from your site is being sent to a third party's site. In
some legislations you may have to inform your users about this fact -
please check with your local privacy laws.
</p>


<p>Sending information to an external site may also be
undesirable on
some setups, e.g. on a company intranet. You can disable SLV support by
removing the four files SLV.Examine.class.php, SLVbase.class.php,
SLVreport.Action.class.php, and SLVwhitelist.Admin.class.php from your
Spam-X directory (/path/to/glfusion/plugins/spamx). Or you can simply
disable the Spam-X plugin entirely (or uninstall it).
</p>


<p>The SLV Examine and Action modules will extract all URLs from
a post
and only send those to SLV (i.e. the rest of the post's content is not
being sent). They also remove any links that contain your glFusion
site's <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>.
In case a post does not contain any external links, the modules simply
do not contact SLV at all.
</p>


</div>


<h2><a name="personal_blacklist" id="personal_blacklist">Personal
Blacklist</a></h2>


<div class="level2">
<p>The Personal Blacklist module lets you add keywords and URLs
that
typically exist in spam posts. When you're being hit by spam, make sure
to add the URLs of those spam posts to your Personal Blacklist so that
they can be filtered out automatically, should the spammer try to post
them again.
</p>


<p>This will also help you get rid of spam that made it through,
as you
can then use the Mass Delete Comments and Mass Delete Trackbacks
modules to easily remove large numbers of spam posts from your
database.
</p>


<p>The Personal Blacklist also has an option to import the
glFusion
censor list and ban all comments which contain one of those words. This
or an expanded list might be useful for a website that caters to
children. Then no comments with offensive language could be posted.
</p>


</div>


<h2><a name="ip_filter" id="ip_filter">IP
Filter</a></h2>


<div class="level2">
<p>Sometimes you will encounter spam that is coming from one or
only a
few IP addresses. By simply adding those IP addresses to the IP Filter
module, any posts from these IPs will be blocked automatically.
</p>


<p>
In addition to single IP addresses, you can also add IP address ranges,
either in CIDR notation or as simple from-to ranges.
</p>


<p>Please note that IP addresses aren't really a good filter
criterion.
While some ISPs and hosting services are known to host spammers, it
won't help much to block an IP address by one of the well-known ISPs.
Often, the spammer will get a new IP address the next time he connects
to the internet, while the blocked IP address will be reused and may be
used by some innocent user.
</p>


</div>


<h2><a name="ip_of_url_filter" id="ip_of_url_filter">IP
of URL Filter</a></h2>


<div class="level2">
<p>This module is only useful in a few special cases: Here you
enter
the IP address of a webserver that is used to host domains for which
you may see spam. Some spammers have a lot of their sites on only a few
webservers, so instead of adding lots of domains to your blacklist, you
only add the IP addresses of those webservers. The Spam-X module will
then check all the URLs in a post to see if any of these is hosted on
one of those blacklisted webservers.
</p>


</div>


<h2><a name="http_header_filter" id="http_header_filter">HTTP
Header Filter</a></h2>


<div class="level2">
<p>This module lets you filter for certain <acronym title="Hyper Text Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym>
headers. Every <acronym title="Hyper Text Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym>
request sent to your site is accompanied by a series of headers
identifying, for example, the browser that your visitors uses, their
preferred language, and other information.
</p>


<p>
With the Header filter module, you can block <acronym title="Hyper Text Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym>
requests with certain headers. For example, some spammers are using <acronym title="Practical Extraction and Report Language">Perl</acronym>
scripts to send their spam posts. The user agent (browser
identification) sent by <acronym title="Practical Extraction and Report Language">Perl</acronym>
scripts is usually something like
&ldquo;libwww-perl/5.805&rdquo; (the version
number may vary). So to block posts made by this user agent, you would
enter:
</p>


<table class="inline">


  <tbody>


    <tr class="row0">


      <td class="col0 leftalign">Header: </td>


      <td class="col1 leftalign">User-Agent </td>


    </tr>


    <tr class="row1">


      <td class="col0 leftalign">Content: </td>


      <td class="col1 leftalign">^libwww-perl </td>


    </tr>


  
  </tbody>
</table>


<p>
This would block all posts from user agents beginning with
&ldquo;libwww-perl&rdquo;.
</p>


</div>


<h2><a name="action_modules" id="action_modules">Action
Modules</a></h2>


<div class="level2">
<p>Once one of the examine modules detects a spam post, the
action
modules will decide what to do with the spam. Most of the time, you
will simply want to delete the post then, so this is what the Delete
Action module does.
</p>


<p>As the name implies, the Mail Admin Action module sends an
email to
the site admin when a spam post is encountered. Since this can cause
quite a lot of emails being sent, it is disabled by default.
</p>


<p>Action modules have to be enabled specifically before they are
used
(examine modules, on the other hand, are activated by simply dropping
them into the Spam-X directory). For this, every action module has a
unique number that needs to be added up with the number of the other
action modules you want to enable and entered as the value for the
spamx config variable in glFusion's main configuration.
</p>


</div>


<h2><a name="example" id="example">Example</a></h2>


<div class="level2">
<p>The Delete Action module has the value 128, while the Mail
Admin
Action module has the value 8. So to activate both modules, add 128 + 8
= 136 and enter that in the Configuration admin panel.
</p>


<p>The SLV Examine module is complemented by a SLV Action module
that
ensures that SLV is notified of spam posts caught by other examine
modules. It &ldquo;piggybacks&rdquo; on the Delete Action
module, i.e. when you
activate the Delete Action module, you'll also enable the SLV Action
module.
</p>


</div>


<h2><a name="admin_modules" id="admin_modules">Admin
Modules</a></h2>


<div class="level2">
<p>The Admin modules for the Personal Blacklist, IP Filter, IP of
<acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>
Filter, and <acronym title="Hyper Text Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym>
Header Filter modules provide you with a form to add new entries. To
delete an existing entry, simply click on it.
</p>


<p>With the SLV Whitelist admin module you can add URLs that you
don't
want to be reported to SLV. This is useful when posts on your site
happen to contain certain URLs quite often but you don't want those to
be considered spam by SLV.
Note that your site's <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>
(i.e. $_CONF['site_url']) is automatically whitelisted, so you don't
need to add it here.
</p>


<p>
The Log View module lets you inspect and clear the Spam-X logfile. The
logfile contains additional information about the spam posts, e.g.
which IP address they came from, the user id (if posted by a logged-in
user), and which of the examine modules caught the spam post.
</p>


<p>In case a large number of spam posts made it through without
being
caught, the Mass Delete Comments and Mass Delete Trackbacks modules
will help you get rid of them easily. Before you use these modules,
make sure to add the URLs or keywords from those spams to your Personal
Blacklist.
</p>


</div>


<h2><a name="trackback_spam" id="trackback_spam">Trackback
Spam</a></h2>


<p>Trackbacks are also run through Spam-X before they will be
accepted
by glFusion. There are also some additional checks that can be
performed on trackbacks: glFusion can be configured to check if the
site that supposedly sent the trackback actually contains a link back
to your site. In addition, glFusion can also check if the IP address of
the site in the trackback <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>
matches the IP address that sent the trackback. Trackbacks that fail
any of these tests are usually spam. Please refer to the documentation
for the configuration for more information.
