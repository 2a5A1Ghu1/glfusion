<h1>Calendar Plugin</h1>


<p>The Calendar plugin provides a robust event management system.</p>


<h2><a name="config.php">Configuration</a></h2>


<p>The calendar's configuration can be changed from the Configuration admin
panel:</p>

  <td>When set to True, only registered users can access the calendar<br>
Please note that Login Required setting in glFusion's main
configuration takes precedence over this setting. So when&nbsp;Login
Required is True, anonymous users can not access the calendar even when
this setting is False.</td>

    user of the "Root" group (e.g. the site admin). When set to 1, the events
    are deleted. This only applies to site events - a user's personal events

are also relevant for the calendar plugin:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Times and dates are formatted according to the current language and the
    <a href="config.html#locale">locale settings</a> from glFusion's main
    configuration.</li>
