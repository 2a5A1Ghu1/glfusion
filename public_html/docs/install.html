<p>
To successfully install and use glFusion you must have a fully operational web server, a database, and the server side scripting language <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>.  glFusion is developed and tested primarily on the Apache web server version 2.x, but it should run on any modern web server.  glFusion has been successfully installed and is running on other web servers such as Zeus, Lighttpd, and Microsoft <acronym title="Internet Information Services">IIS</acronym>.
</p>

<p>
glFusion still supports <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> v4.x, but the <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> Foundation has already announced the end of life of the v4.x branch.  Using <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> v5.x series is a better long term choice.  Currently, the Web Services feature of glFusion requires <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> 5.  If you are running <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> v4.x, Web Services will be automatically disabled.

</p>

<p>
glFusion supports only MySQL, unlike Geeklog which supports both MySQL and Microsoft <acronym title="Structured Query Language">SQL</acronym> Server database engines.  glFusion does not officially support Microsoft <acronym title="Structured Query Language">SQL</acronym> Server because several of the included plugins have not been certified to run with <acronym title="Microsoft">MS</acronym> <acronym title="Structured Query Language">SQL</acronym>.<br/>

<p>
glFusion is designed where some of the files should reside outside of the web root, meaning they should not be directly accessible from the Internet.  For most users this does not pose a problem, but some hosting services do not allow users to store files outside of the main web accessible directory.  For these users, you can still install glFusion, but you will want to follow the directions in the installing glFusion in the web root section.
</p>

<p>
Make sure you know where your web root is on your server.  This is different than your website&#039;s <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym> address.  You may need to contact your hosting provider for assistance.  It is important that you know this information prior to performing the installation.

</p>

<div class="noteclassic">
If you are not sure how to determine your paths, contact your hosting provider’s Technical Support Staff, they can generally help you out.

<div class="level2">

<p>
Before we install glFusion, you will need to know a few key pieces of information.  Write down the following information. If you are unsure what to put for each of the items below, please contact your system administrator or you hosting provider.

<h1><a name="assumptions" id="assumptions">Assumptions</a></h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
These installation instructions assume that you will be running your glFusion site as the main site on your domain.  If your installation will be a sub-domain or a set of sub-pages of an existing site, you will need to adjust some of the paths.
</p>

</div>

<h1><a name="create_the_glfusion_database" id="create_the_glfusion_database">Create the glFusion Database</a></h1>

<div class="level1">

<p>
glFusion requires a MySQL database.  Depending on your hosting solution, you may need to create a new database for glFusion and also a database user account.  Some hosting providers setup a single database for your account that should be used.  If you already have a database created that you wish to use, you can skip this section.
</p>

</div>

<h2><a name="create_the_database" id="create_the_database">Create the Database</a></h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
Depending on your hosting solution, you may be able to create a new empty database using online tools provided by your hosting provider.  You can also use a tool like phpMyAdmin to create the database.
</p>

<p>

Once you have created the database, record the name of the new database above in the Pre-Installation Tasks section.
</p>

</div>

<h2><a name="create_the_database_user" id="create_the_database_user">Create the Database User</a></h2>

<p>
It is always a good security practice to create a unique user account for each database.  Create a new database user and add the following permissions to the user for the database you created in the previous step:

If you do not have shell access to your server and can only use an <acronym title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</acronym> client to access your server, follow these instructions.
</p>

<p>
To install glFusion you will need to un-archive the distribution on your local computer.  The glFusion distribution archive will automatically create all the proper directories when it is un-archived.
</p>

<p>
To un-archive a .gz file, you can use recent versions of <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.rarlab.com/"  rel="nofollow">WinRAR</a> or <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.7-zip.org/"  rel="nofollow">7-Zip</a>.  If you are running <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.apple.com/macosx/"  rel="nofollow">Mac OSX</a>, please ensure you have the latest version of <a href="http://my.smithmicro.com/mac/stuffitdeluxe/index.html" class="urlextern" title="http://my.smithmicro.com/mac/stuffitdeluxe/index.html"  rel="nofollow">StuffIt</a> installed as previous versions have had difficulty properly un-archiving .gz files.  For Linux/Unix users, use the standard <code>tar</code> command to extract the distribution.

<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Create a temporary directory on your local hard drive to hold the glFusion distribution files.  We will use C:\tmp for our example.</div>

Many hosting providers have a tool called Fantastico that will automatically install Geeklog.  We do not recommend using this tool because it will create an unsecure installation of Geeklog.  Instead, we recommend that you follow the installation procedures above and manually install Geeklog or glFusion.  By following the manual installation procedures, you’ll ensure that you have the latest version of Geeklog or glFusion and that your site is securely installed.

<pre class="code">
chmod -R 777 logs
chmod –R 777 data
chmod –R 777 backups
… do this for all the directories listed above…</pre>

If you use <acronym title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</acronym> to upload files to your server, you can use your <acronym title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</acronym> program to change the permissions. Below is an example of using FileZilla as the <acronym title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</acronym> program to set permissions:

<div class="level1">

<p>

Before you begin the upgrade process, make a good backup of your source files and your database.  The upgrade process is generally very safe, however, there is always the possibility that something could go wrong and part of any good upgrade plan is a good back out plan.
</p>

<div class="notewarning">
If you have made any customizations to Geeklog’s core files or the theme files, ensure you save a copy of your modifications.

</div>

<p>
glFusion brings some major architectural changes that break away from how upgrades were handled in previous versions of Geeklog.  The main change is that the config.php file is no longer used by glFusion.  Instead, most of the configuration options are now maintained with an online configuration editor and the configuration files are automatically updated during the upgrade process.  There are a few configuration options that are still maintained in the db-config.php (database settings) and siteconfig.php (site specific options such as Character Set), but you should not have to edit these files directly.  Also, you no longer need to edit lib-common.php to specify the path to config.php as you did with previous versions of Geeklog.
</p>

<p>
The upgrade process does not migrate your existing configuration options from the old config.php file.  You will need to enter the Online Configuration section after the upgrade and set the options to meet your specific needs.

There are several theme changes that must be made to custom themes to allow glFusion to work properly.

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> glFusion has 3 configuration files that are needed.  The distribution includes skeleton versions that will need to be renamed or copied to the correct filename.

Take extreme care to back up any files from your current Geeklog installations that have any custom code in them, especially lib-custom.php (where all custom code should reside). Be sure to back up any modified themes and images from your current installation.

Open your browser and navigate to the glFusion installation wizard. The path to this file will depend on where you chose to put the glFusion files on your web server. The default location is:
</p>

<p>
<code>http://[your_glfusion_site]/admin/install/index.php</code>
</p>

<p>
The installation wizard was designed to automate the upgrade process. Simply follow the installation steps.  Please note that only &#039;basic&#039; version numbers are listed, because, for example, Geeklog 1.4.1 and 1.4.1sr2 use the same database. So if you&#039;re upgrading from Geeklog 1.4.1sr2, just select &#039;1.4.1&#039;.
</p>

<p>

Once you have completed the upgrade be sure to delete the admin/install directory.
</p>

<p>
Congratulations! You now have glFusion successfully installed.  Please take a moment to review the rest of this manual to better understand how to administer the features and functions of this software.

Once you have successfully upgraded your site, there are a few things you will want to double check.

</p>
<ul>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Go into the online configuration system and validate your configuration settings</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> If you had the Forum plugin installed, you will need to go into the Forum administration screens and select <strong>Resync</strong> for each of your forums. This will build the necessary last post information and correctly set the new counters in the database.</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>REMOVE THE INSTALLATION DIRECTORY</strong> </div>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h1><a name="upgrading_from_geeklog_v1.5.0" id="upgrading_from_geeklog_v1.5.0">Upgrading From Geeklog v1.5.0</a></h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
If you already have Geeklog v1.5.0 installed, upgrading to glFusion is very simple.  All you will need to do is copy the glFusion distribution over your existing Geeklog distribution.  There is no need to run the upgrade utility since glFusion and Geeklog use the same database structure.
</p>

<p>
You will need to install the <strong>Site Tailor</strong> plugin by going into the Plugin administration screen and selecting <strong>Install</strong> for Site Tailor.

</p>

<p>
If you had any of the glFusion bundled plugins installed, you may need to run the upgrade routine for each of them.  From the <strong>Plugins</strong> administration screen, check to see if any of the plugins show an upgrade option.
</p>

</div>

<h1><a name="pre-installed_plugins" id="pre-installed_plugins">Pre-Installed Plugins</a></h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
glFusion comes with the following plugins pre-installed,


</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Bad Behavior2</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> CAPTCHA</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> FileMgmt</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Forum</div>

</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Media Gallery</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

If any of these plugins were already installed on your site, they were automatically updated during the upgrade process.
</p>

<p>
If some of these plugins were not previously installed prior to the upgrade, they were not installed during the upgrade.  The files are on your system and are ready to be installed, but you will need to go into the Plugin Editor to manually install them.
