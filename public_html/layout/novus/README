Theme: Novus v1.0 for glFusion v1.2.0
Theme by: Eric Warren - glFusion (http://www.glfusion.org)
Last updated: 23 November 2008
========================================
Novus is a fixed & fluid width, light blue and white neutral theme that is included in a default
glFusion install. Only files that differ from the default Nouveau theme need be included in the
Novus folder.

For complete documentation please visit: http://www.glfusion.org/wiki/doku.php?id=glfusion:nouveau.

Briefly, Novus features:

- Tableless markup. All appropriate markup is created with <div> tags and other elements.

- SEO friendly design where content comes first in the code, followed by side blocks.

- Both Fluid and Fixed width versions of the theme, one line configurable in header.thtml.

- Validates to HTML 4.01 Transitional, HTML 4.01 Strict or
  XHTML Transitional 1.0 via a switch in the theme's functions.php)

- Support for glFusion's Menu Builder cascading menus.

- Additional typography elements with enhanced block class styling, quote & code styling, list
  styling, and more.

- Extra block styling options for both left and right blocks.

- YUI grids.css support.

We have tested it in Firefox 2/3, IE 6/7, Opera 9, Safari beta 3 on Windows, and Google Chrome. In other browsers, your mileage may vary.

The Novus theme was originally created for the Joomla! CMS by the team at
http://www.rockettheme.com/ and was released as a free template under the terms
of the GPL license. You can view the original demo at http://demo.rockettheme.com/novus-j10/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=1 and

THINGS FOR YOU TO DO
====================
1. We have included both fluid (default) and fixed width versions of this theme.
   In header.thtml, simply change line 2 to your desired layout type:

       <div id="gl_container_fluid"><!-- options are fixed or fluid-->

2. We have included several different block styles with this theme. To change styles,
   open either leftblocks.thtml or rightblocks.thtml and modify class=“gl_blockstyle1”.

   For documentation and graphic examples, please visit:
   http://www.glfusion.org/wiki/doku.php?id=glfusion:nouveau#extra_block_styles

3. We've styled the plugin css declarations in style.css, but individual plugins
   that use their own style.css file will need to be edited manually. Here are
   the default colors used for this theme:

     #A80C06 is the color of typical links (red).
     #26647B is the color of typical active links (teal).
     #153F52 is the color of visited links (dark teal).
     #000000/666666 is the color of text (black/grey).
     #F6FCFC is the color of the main background.
     #FFFFFF is the color of the block backgrounds.
