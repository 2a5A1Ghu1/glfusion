  included some MooTools based javascript widgets. For more info on using them, visit:

- Additional typography elements with enhanced block class styling, quote and code styling, list
  styling, and more.

THINGS FOR YOU TO DO
====================
1. We have included both fluid (default) and fixed width versions of this theme.
   In header.thtml, simply change line 2 to your desired layout type:

       <div id="gl_container_fluid"><!-- options are fixed or fluid-->

2. We have included several different block styles with this theme. To change styles,
   open either leftblocks.thtml or rightblocks.thtml and modify class=“gl_blockstyle1”.

3. We've styled the plugin css declarations in style.css, but individual plugins
   that use their own style.css file will need to be edited manually. Here are
   the default colors used for this theme:

     #0000FF is the color of typical links (blue).
     #008000 is the color of typical active links (green).
