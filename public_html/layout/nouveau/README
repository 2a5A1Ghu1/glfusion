Theme: Nouveau v1.0 for Geeklog v1.5
Theme by: Eric Warren - gl Labs (http://www.gllabs.org)
Last updated: 29 April 2008
========================================
Nouveau is a fixed & fluid width, blue and grey neutral theme intended as a suppliment to the
professional theme that is included in a default Geeklog install. For complete documentation
please visit http://www.gllabs.org/wiki/doku.php?id=geeklog:themes:nouveau.

Briefly, Nouveau features:

- Small size thanks to using Joe Mucchiello's Caching Template Library found at
  http://www.gllabs.org/wiki/doku.php?id=geeklog:templatecache. Only .thtml files that
  differ from the stock Professional theme that ships with Geeklog, are needed to
  complete this theme. CTL version 2.3.1 or higher is required.
  
  *******************************************************************************
  * Please make sure you have both the Caching Template Library v2.3.1+ and the *
  * the professional theme installed, as this theme depends on files contained  *
  * in {public_html}/layout/professional/ directory.                            *
  *******************************************************************************

- Tableless markup. All appropriate markup is created with <div> tags and other elements.

- SEO friendly where content comes first in the code, followed by side blocks.

- Both Fluid and Fixed width versions of the theme, one line configurable in header.thtml.

- Validates to HTML 4.01 Transitional (for GL v1.4.1 version, GL v1.5 to be HTML 4.01 Strict or
  XHTML Transitional 1.0 via a switch in the theme's functions.php)

- Support for a 4 level cascading menu in the header.

- MooTools Javascript Library v1.11 integration. (learn more at http://mootools.net) We have also
  included some MooTools based javascript widgets. For more info on using them, visit:
  http://www.gllabs.org/wiki/doku.php?id=geeklog:themes:nouveau

- Additional typography elements with enhanced block class styling, quote and code styling, list
  styling, and more.
  
- Extra block styling options for both left and right blocks.

- YUI reset-fonts-grids.css, and base-min.css support.

We have tested it in Firefox 2, IE 6/7, Opera 9, and Safari beta 3 on Windows. In other browsers, your
mileage may vary. Check out a working demo at http://nouveau.gllabs.org. Download the latest version at http://www.gllabs.org/filemgmt/index.php?id=191. Grab the latest development SVN version at http://geiss.getmyip.com:81/svn/nouveau-ctl/trunk (login/password: everyone/everyone).

As always, we appreciate the years of hard work and dedication of the core Geeklog developers.

When applicable, those license terms take precedence those declared above.

DEPENDENCIES
============
1. Nouveau requires that you have the Caching Template Library v2.3.1 installed. This
   library speeds up the rendering of your site by compiling templates for faster page
   loads. Another feature is that one can specify multiple locations to look for
   templates. Using this feature allows us to only include template files that differ
   from the stock default theme included with Geeklog. 

   To download the latest version of the CTL (v2.3.1 or higher required), visit:
   http://www.gllabs.org/filemgmt/index.php?id=192
   
   For complete instructions on installing the CTL, visit:
   http://www.gllabs.org/wiki/doku.php?id=geeklog:templatecache

2. As explained above, you will need to make sure you have the default theme that comes
   included with Geeklog (currently "professional") installed. Unless you deleted or
   renamed it, you should be fine. You can always grab a fresh copy of the theme from
   the Geeklog v1.4.1 tarball at: http://www.geeklog.net/filemgmt/index.php?id=803

3. To use the advanced story editor, edit your {public_html}/admin/story.php file and
   around line 435 change:
   
   && file_exists ($_CONF['path_layout'] . '/admin/story/storyeditor_advanced.thtml')) {
   to
   && file_exists ($_CONF['path_html'] . '/layout/professional/admin/story/storyeditor_advanced.thtml')) {

INSTALLATION
============
Make sure you have the dependencies installed as noted in the previous section.

Unzip all of the contents of this theme and upload into your public_html/layout/
directory. Once uploaded, you should have 2 or more folders, including "professional",
and "nouveau".

If you would like to change the theme for only you, login to your site and click on
My Account in the User Functions block. Then click on the Layout & Language tab,
and choose "nouveau" under the Theme dropdown box.

If you would like to make the entire site pick up on the change, edit
your {path_to_geeklog}/config.php and change the default theme from
"professional" to "nouveau" like this:

$_CONF['theme']             = 'nouveau';  // default theme

THINGS FOR YOU TO DO
====================
1. We have included both fluid (default) and fixed width versions of this theme.
   In header.thtml, simply change line 2 to your desired layout type:

       <div id="gl_container_fluid"><!-- options are fixed or fluid-->
	   
2. We have included several different block styles with this theme. To change styles,
   open either leftblocks.thtml or rightblocks.thtml and modify class=“gl_blockstyle1”.
  
   For documentation and graphic examples, please visit:
   http://www.gllabs.org/wiki/doku.php?id=geeklog:themes:nouveau#extra_block_styles

3. We've styled the plugin css declarations in style.css, but individual plugins
   that use their own style.css file will need to be edited manually. Here are
   the default colors used for this theme:
 
     #0000FF is the color of typical links (blue).
     #008000 is the color of typical active links (green).
     #800080 is the color of visited links (purple).
     #000000/666666 is the color of text (black/grey).
     #FFFFFF is the color of the main background.
     #F7F7F7 is the color of the block backgrounds.
     #CCCCCC is the color of the block header backgrounds.

4. Change the flags in the header to reflect whatever you like. There are more public
   domain flag icons at http://www.gllabs.org/wiki/doku.php?id=geeklog:themes:nouveau.
   To use them, simply un-zip them and copy them into /nouveau/images" directory, and
   make the appropriate changes to header.thtml to pull the new images.

5. Visit http://www.gllabs.org/wiki/doku.php?id=geeklog:themes:nouveau and learn
   about how to use the additional MooTools javascript widgets included with Nouveau. 
   From content sliders and news tickers, to custom tool tips, header rotators and more,
   Nouveau gives you the flexibility and power to make your site unique!
