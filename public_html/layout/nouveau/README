Theme: Nouveau v1.0 for glFusion v1.0
Theme by: Eric Warren - gl Labs (http://www.glfusion.org)
Last updated: 29 April 2008
========================================
Nouveau is a fixed & fluid width, blue and grey neutral theme intended as a suppliment to the
professional theme that is included in a default glFusion install. For complete documentation
please visit http://www.glfusion.org/wiki/doku.php?id=glfusion:nouveau.

Briefly, Nouveau features:

- Tableless markup. All appropriate markup is created with <div> tags and other elements.

- SEO friendly where content comes first in the code, followed by side blocks.

- Both Fluid and Fixed width versions of the theme, one line configurable in header.thtml.

- Validates to HTML 4.01 Transitional, HTML 4.01 Strict or
  XHTML Transitional 1.0 via a switch in the theme's functions.php)

- Support for a 4 level cascading menu in the header.

- MooTools Javascript Library v1.11 integration. (learn more at http://mootools.net) We have also
  included some MooTools based javascript widgets. For more info on using them, visit:
  http://www.glfusion.org/wiki/doku.php?id=glfusion:nouveau

- Additional typography elements with enhanced block class styling, quote and code styling, list
  styling, and more.

- Extra block styling options for both left and right blocks.

- YUI reset-fonts-grids.css, and base-min.css support.

We have tested it in Firefox 2, IE 6/7, Opera 9, and Safari beta 3 on Windows. In other browsers, your
mileage may vary. Check out a working demo at http://nouveau.gllabs.org. Download the latest version at http://www.gllabs.org/filemgmt/index.php?id=191. Grab the latest development SVN version at http://geiss.getmyip.com:81/svn/nouveau-ctl/trunk (login/password: everyone/everyone).

THINGS FOR YOU TO DO
====================
1. We have included both fluid (default) and fixed width versions of this theme.
   In header.thtml, simply change line 2 to your desired layout type:

       <div id="gl_container_fluid"><!-- options are fixed or fluid-->

2. We have included several different block styles with this theme. To change styles,
   open either leftblocks.thtml or rightblocks.thtml and modify class=“gl_blockstyle1”.

   For documentation and graphic examples, please visit:
   http://www.glfusion.org/wiki/doku.php?id=glfusion:nouveau#extra_block_styles

3. We've styled the plugin css declarations in style.css, but individual plugins
   that use their own style.css file will need to be edited manually. Here are
   the default colors used for this theme:

     #0000FF is the color of typical links (blue).
     #008000 is the color of typical active links (green).
     #800080 is the color of visited links (purple).
     #000000/666666 is the color of text (black/grey).
     #FFFFFF is the color of the main background.
     #F7F7F7 is the color of the block backgrounds.
     #CCCCCC is the color of the block header backgrounds.

4. Change the flags in the header to reflect whatever you like. There are more public
   domain flag icons at http://www.glfusion.org/wiki/doku.php?id=glfusion:nouveau.
   To use them, simply un-zip them and copy them into /nouveau/images" directory, and
   make the appropriate changes to header.thtml to pull the new images.

5. Visit http://www.glfusion.org/wiki/doku.php?id=glfusion:nouveau and learn
   about how to use the additional MooTools javascript widgets included with Nouveau.
   From content sliders and news tickers, to custom tool tips, header rotators and more,
   Nouveau gives you the flexibility and power to make your site unique!
