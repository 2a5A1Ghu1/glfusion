## Supported Versions

### glFusion v1.7.x Long Term Support 

glFusion v1.7.x is a Long Term Support (LTS) release, which means we will continue to support this version for at least 2 years, providing quarterly bug and security releases as needed. Why a LTS release you ask? Our plan is to focus on efforts on developing glFusion v2.0 which will build on a new, more modern, code base to drive improved functionality, usability and security. We expect glFusion v2.0 is going to take some time and to ensure we continue to provide a secure and robust CMS, we will continue to maintain the v1.7.x branch during this time.

glFusion v2.0 is under active development and will be the target for all new feature requests.
