glFusion ChangeLog

v1.0.1
------------
- Fixed an error when saving a user submitted story directly to the
  story table (instead of the submission table).  Invalid date for expire
  date.
        private/system/classes/story.class.php

- Fixed reference to geeklog.net in config.class.php for the help  links
        private/system/classes/config.class.php

- Fixed a layout issue with the typography styles (class="arrow"...).
  The margin-left was set to -2em which prevented the bullets from showing.
  Changed to 2em which seems to clear it up.
        public_html/layout/nouveau/style.css

- Updated PLG_uninstall to supress errors for table drop.
        private/system/lib-plugins.php

- Fixed INST_checkTableExists for MS SQL Support.
        public_html/admin/install/index.php

- COM_displayErrorandAbort() sends an HTTP header which conflicts with the
  header sent in COM_siteHeader().  Example, user used trackback URL for a
  calendar event instead of proper URL, gives Output already started error.
  Removed the additional header() calls.
        public_html/lib-common.php

- New comments were not clearing the instance cache for the story or the
  what's new block. Also deleted comments did not update instance cache
        private/system/lib-comment.php

- Search results return duplicate entries for stories when URL rewrite enabled.
        private/system/classes/search.class.php

- Implemented instance caching on stories.
        private/system/lib-story.php
        private/system/classes/story.class.php

- Unable to delete some plugins because $_DB_table_prefix and $_TABLES
  is not defined in plugins.php
        public_html/admin/plugins.php

- Changed SEC_createToken so that it will only return one token per page
  (effectively making it a singleton). This fixes the problem of not being able
  to delete comments when you also have trackbacks for the same article
        private/system/lib-security.php

- Approving a story submission by saving it from the Admin's story editor left
  a duplicate in the submission queue, unless you changed the story ID at the
  same time
        private/system/lib-story.php
        private/system/classes/story.class.php

- Removed extra <br> between introtext and body text when viewing the full story
        private/system/lib-story.php

- Removed unnecessary code ($day is overwritten in the next line).
        public_html/directory.php

- Installation would fail when MySQL in strict mode when trying to insert the
  default story into the database (expire field was '').
        private/sql/mysql_tableanddata.php

Calendar plugin
---------------
- Calendar block now includes events from the current day (in progress or all
  day events.
        private/plugins/calendar/functions.inc

Forum plugin
------------
- Fixed issue where the 'View all New Posts' link was not being displayed.
        public_html/forum/index.php

Links plugin
------------
- Fixed SQL error when trying to change a category id to an already existing id
- Fixed new category silently overwriting an existing category if they had the
  same id
        private/plugins/links/language/english.php
        private/plugins/links/language/english_utf-8.php
        public_html/admin/plugins/links/category.php
