1. Installation
===============

Standard plugin install. Unzip the archive, copy the contents of the admin
folder to /path/to/geeklog/public_html/admin/plugins/commentfeeds and the rest
of the files to /path/to/geeklog/plugins/commentfeeds.

Then, visit http://www.example.com/admin/plugins.php and click the install link
for the commentfeeds plugin.

2. Usage
========

The plugin itself has no admin or anything at all. All you need to do is go to
your geeklog instance's syndication feed admin and add a new Commentfeed feed,
you can have it cover comments against all topics, or just comments for a
particular topic. You may have as many feeds as you like. Exactly like the
feeds for articles, but only containing comments.

You should choose a type of RSS 2.0.

The system will only list comments to articles that the anonymous user has
access to, this includes requiring access to the appropriate geeklog topic.
