This directory contains the PEAR packages that are needed by glFusion. If you
don't have PEAR installed on your webserver, simply set the "Have Pear?" option
in the configutation to "False" and glFusion will pick up the PEAR packages from
here.

Currently, glFusion uses the following PEAR packages:

- Archive_Tar
- Auth_SASL
- Console_Getopt
- HTTP_OAuth
- HTTP_Request
- HTTP_Request2
- Net_DNS
- Net_SMTP
- Net_Socket
- Net_URL
- Net_URL2
- PEAR
- Services_ShortURL
- Structures_Graph
- XML_RPC
- XML_Util

The Console package is included as they are used by the base PEAR package
(e.g. when you try to update PEAR) but are not used by glFusion itself.
