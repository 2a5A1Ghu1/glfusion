This is the directory where glFusion will store database backups from the
"DB Backups" menu entry. Please note that glFusion only lists the last 10
backups - the directory may contain more files (old backups are NOT deleted).

To restore a backup, either use phpMyAdmin or type

    mysql -u{user_name} -p -D {database_name} < {backup_file}

on the command line, replacing {user_name}, {database_name}, and {backup_file}
with the correct values (do not include the curly brackets).
